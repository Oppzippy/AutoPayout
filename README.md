## Commands

/payout - Toggle AutoPayout UI

## Usage

Data is stored in a CSV with the first column being player names and the second being gold. The unit is configurable in the addon's settings (copper, silver, gold, 10k gold). The addon will attempt to send mail until you're mail capped and then provide you with a CSV containing all unsent mail. That can then be copy and pasted to another WoW account until payouts are done.
